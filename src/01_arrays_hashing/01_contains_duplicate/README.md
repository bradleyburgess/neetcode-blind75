## âœ¨ Initial Thoughts

Duplicates are a red flag for brute force, but with better spaceâ€“time trade-offs
we can find faster solutions using hashing or sorting. Sets give us
constant-time lookups, and sorted arrays give us predictable neighbors.

## ğŸš€ Solutions

### 1. Brute Force / Naive Approach

**Approach:**  
Check every pair in a nested loop. If any pair is equal, return true.

**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(nÂ²)  
- Space: O(1)

**Trade-offs:**  
- Easy to write and understand
- Very inefficient for large arrays

### 2. Hashmap

**Approach:**  
Store each item in a hashmap (dict). If it's already there, it's a duplicate.

**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)

**Trade-offs:**  
- Very fast
- Extra memory usage

### 3. Sort and Compare

**Approach:**  
Sort the array and compare each item to its neighbor.

**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(n log n)  
- Space: O(1) (or O(n) depending on sorting algorithm)

**Trade-offs:**  
- Slightly slower than hashmap
- Avoids extra data structures

## ğŸ§ª Tests (edge cases)

Edge cases include:
- Empty array
- Single element
- All elements identical
- No duplicates at all

---

## ğŸ“Œ Reflections & Takeaways

- Hash-based solutions often give the best time complexity for lookup problems.
- Sorting is a reliable fallback if space is a constraint or hash use isn't ideal.
- Writing multiple approaches clarified trade-offs in readability vs performance.
